	As a user of the Mixer

	So that Mixer can provide more accurate cocktail recommendation

	Background: User is logged in and is asked to set cocktail serving size

		Given I am signed up for Mixer
		And I am logged in to Mixer
		And I am prompted to indicate my preferred cocktail serving size
		And the options listed are
			| individual | group |

	Scenario: Valid cocktail serving size set (Normal Flow)

		When I select a serving size of <size>
		And I confirm my serving size selection
		Then the system will save the preferred cocktail serving size as <size>
		And the system will display the next prompt

		Examples:
